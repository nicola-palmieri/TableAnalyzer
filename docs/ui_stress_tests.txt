UI Stress Test Checklist (Big Release)
======================================

Purpose
-------
This checklist covers high-stress, edge-case, and regression tests for the Table Analyzer UI.
Focus on consistency between inputs, results, and visualizations, clear validation messages,
and stability under repeated changes.

Test data matrix
----------------
Use 4 datasets (or one dataset you can edit to match these cases):
- Small: 50-200 rows, 6-10 columns, mixed numeric/categorical.
- Medium: 5k-20k rows, 15-30 columns, missing values, 1-2 high-cardinality factors.
- Large: 100k+ rows, 40+ columns, 5+ numeric, 5+ categorical, some zero-variance columns.
- Edge: all-NA column, single-level factor, text-only column, date/time column.

How to use
----------
- Start a fresh session for each dataset.
- Repeat each test 2-3 times and in different orders.
- Note any mismatch between widgets, plots, warnings, and results panels.

Core navigation and session state
---------------------------------
1) Cold start: open app, verify only Upload enabled.
2) Upload data, confirm Filter, Analyze, Visualize tabs enable.
3) Switch tabs rapidly (Home -> Upload -> Filter -> Analyze -> Visualize) 20+ times.
4) Refresh browser; confirm app state resets cleanly.
5) Open Visualize before running any analysis and confirm empty state messaging.
6) Open Analyze, select a method, do not run; switch tabs and return; selection persists.
7) Open two browser tabs with the app; ensure actions in one do not corrupt the other.
8) Simultaneous inputs: change a control while a plot is rendering; no UI freeze.
9) Leave app idle for 5+ minutes; resume interaction; no stale state errors.
10) Resize browser window repeatedly; UI stays usable and does not overlap.

Upload tab stress
-----------------
11) Upload supported file, re-upload same file; ensure UI resets properly.
12) Upload a different file; verify controls update to new variables.
13) Upload a file with non-ASCII header names; UI still renders safely.
14) Upload a file with duplicate column names; verify collision handling or warning.
15) Upload a file with mixed column types; verify type detection.
16) Upload file with empty rows; ensure they are handled safely.
17) Upload invalid file format; confirm warning message and no crash.
18) Large file upload; verify progress and UI remains responsive.
19) Upload file, then remove it (if supported); ensure tabs disable again.
20) Upload dataset with only one numeric column; ensure analysis options warn gracefully.

Filter tab stress
-----------------
21) Apply simple filter on numeric column; verify row count updates.
22) Apply multiple filters across numeric and categorical columns.
23) Remove all filters; data returns to original.
24) Filter to zero rows; downstream tabs should show no-data warnings.
25) Filter to one row; analyses should warn about insufficient data.
26) Rapidly toggle filters on and off; no crash or stale values.
27) Filter out a column used in analysis; analysis results should warn.
28) Use filters that create single-level factors; downstream LMM/ANOVA should warn.
29) Filter to a subset with missing values in response; analysis still handles.
30) Apply filter then change dataset; filter UI should reset for new data.

Analysis selection vs results gating
------------------------------------
31) Run Descriptive, see results; switch selection to One-way ANOVA without running.
    Go to Visualize and confirm it shows run-required empty state (not previous plots).
32) Run One-way ANOVA, then switch selection to PCA without running, then Visualize.
33) Run Pairwise Correlation, then switch to Two-way ANOVA without running.
34) Run Two-way ANOVA, then switch to Descriptive without running.
35) Switch to blank analysis selection (if possible) and confirm Visualize empty state.
36) Run analysis, then change selection and click Run quickly; no UI lockup.
37) Run analysis twice with same inputs; results should be identical.
38) Run analysis, change data filter, rerun; results should change accordingly.
39) Run analysis, clear selection, return to previous; no stale results shown.
40) Run analysis, then open Visualize; ensure visuals match analysis type.
