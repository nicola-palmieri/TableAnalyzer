UI Stress Test Checklist
========================

Purpose
-------
This checklist covers high-stress, edge-case, and regression tests for the Table Analyzer UI.
Focus on consistency between analysis parameters and visualizations, state persistence, and
performance under repeated changes.

How to use
----------
- Start a fresh session.
- Use a medium-sized dataset with mixed numeric/categorical columns and missing values.
- Repeat each test multiple times and in different orders.
- Note any mismatch between widgets, plots, warnings, and results panels.

Core navigation and state
-------------------------
1) Cold start: open app, verify only Upload is enabled.
2) Upload data, confirm Filter, Analyze, Visualize tabs enable.
3) Switch tabs rapidly (Home -> Upload -> Filter -> Analyze -> Visualize) 10+ times.
4) Refresh browser and confirm app state resets cleanly.
5) Open Visualize before running any analysis and confirm empty state messaging.

Analysis selection vs results gating
------------------------------------
6) Run Descriptive, see results; switch Analyze selection to One-way ANOVA without running.
   Go to Visualize and confirm it shows the run-required empty state (not previous plots).
7) Run One-way ANOVA, then switch selection to PCA without running, then Visualize.
8) Run Pairwise Correlation, then switch to Two-way ANOVA without running.
9) Run Two-way ANOVA, then switch to Descriptive without running.
10) Switch to blank analysis selection (if possible) and confirm Visualize empty state.

Analysis rerun consistency
--------------------------
11) Run Descriptive; open Visualize; change plot options; Apply.
    Rerun Descriptive with different variable selections; return to Visualize.
    Verify plot updates with same widget state (except any invalid grid reset).
12) Run One-way ANOVA; set barplot; tweak colors; Apply.
    Change factor order; rerun; Visualize should keep barplot and colors.
13) Run Two-way ANOVA; set boxplot; change legend settings; Apply.
    Change responses; rerun; Visualize should keep plot type and settings.
14) Run PCA; set color/shape/labels; Apply; rerun PCA; Visualize should keep inputs.
15) Run Pairwise Correlation; set grid/size; Apply; rerun; Visualize keeps inputs.

Plot type switching (auto-render)
---------------------------------
16) One-way ANOVA: switch line/bar/box repeatedly; confirm plot updates immediately.
17) Two-way ANOVA: switch line/bar/box repeatedly; confirm plot updates immediately.
18) Descriptive: switch categorical/boxplots/histograms; confirm plot updates immediately.
19) PCA: toggle facets on/off; confirm plot updates without Apply.
20) Pairwise correlation: trigger auto-render on analysis run without Apply.

Grid layout stress
------------------
21) Descriptive with 1 variable: set grid to 3x3; rerun analysis; ensure defaults reset cleanly.
22) Descriptive with many variables: set grid too small; observe warning; Apply; then rerun analysis.
23) One-way ANOVA with multiple responses: set response grid too small; warning; rerun analysis.
24) Two-way ANOVA with strata + responses: set strata grid too large; warning; rerun analysis.
25) Resize grid to max values (10x10) and verify render and scroll behavior.

Plot size stress
----------------
26) Set subplot width/height to minimum and maximum values; ensure render scales correctly.
27) Set extreme sizes, apply, rerun analysis, verify sizes persist.
28) Change plot size while on Visualize then rerun analysis without Apply.

Color customization stress
--------------------------
29) Set single color; rerun analysis; confirm color persists.
30) Set multi-group colors for many levels; rerun analysis; confirm mapping persists.
31) Change grouping variable; verify color inputs update and do not crash.
32) Change factor order; verify color mapping remains aligned to levels.

Legend controls
---------------
33) Enable common legend; change position; rerun analysis; verify persistence.
34) Toggle legend on/off rapidly; confirm plots update without errors.
35) For ANOVA twoway with multiple responses/strata: toggle common legend and re-render.

Stratification stress
---------------------
36) Enable stratification with many levels; run analysis; verify plots and grids.
37) Reduce strata levels and rerun; ensure grids reset to defaults if invalid.
38) Use stratification with missing levels (filtered out) and verify warnings.

Variable selection and data changes
-----------------------------------
39) Remove variables used in plots; rerun analysis; ensure plots update or warn gracefully.
40) Change variable types (e.g., numeric to categorical via Upload editor); rerun analysis.
41) Filter data to near-empty; rerun analysis; confirm no crashes and proper warnings.
42) Use data with all NA in selected variable; verify error/warning handling.

Performance and repeated actions
--------------------------------
43) Run analysis 10 times in a row with small changes; ensure no memory or UI lag issues.
44) Rapidly change plot type + grid size + color, then rerun analysis; verify no crashes.
45) Open Visualize in another browser tab (if possible) and compare consistency.

Download and export
-------------------
46) Download plots after customizing sizes; verify file dimensions match UI.
47) Rerun analysis then download; ensure download reflects latest plot and settings.
48) Download ANOVA results; rerun; ensure file names and contents update.

Regression smoke tests (minimal)
--------------------------------
49) Descriptive: default categorical plot renders immediately after run.
50) One-way ANOVA: default lineplot renders immediately after run.
51) Two-way ANOVA: default lineplot renders immediately after run.
52) Pairwise correlation: plot renders immediately after run without Apply.
53) PCA: plot renders immediately after run without Apply.

Notes to capture for each failure
---------------------------------
- Steps to reproduce (exact order, tabs visited, inputs changed).
- Expected vs actual behavior.
- Any console errors.
- Screenshot of UI state and warnings.
